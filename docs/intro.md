# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics educational modules. This comprehensive course covers the essential concepts and techniques for developing intelligent humanoid robots that operate effectively in real-world environments.

## Course Overview

This course is divided into three main modules:

### Module 1: ROS 2 Middleware for Humanoid Control
Learn the fundamentals of ROS 2 and how to implement distributed control systems for humanoid robots. This module covers:
- Basic ROS 2 concepts and architecture
- Distributed control patterns
- Advanced ROS 2 techniques for real-time robotics

### Module 2: Digital Twin Simulation for Humanoid Robotics
Explore simulation techniques using Gazebo and Unity for developing and testing humanoid robot control algorithms. This module includes:
- Physics simulation with Gazebo
- Visualization with Unity
- Simulation-to-reality transfer techniques

### Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)
Develop advanced perception, localization, and navigation capabilities using NVIDIA Isaac technologies. This module covers:
- Photorealistic simulation with Isaac Sim
- Synthetic data generation for perception models
- Hardware-accelerated VSLAM with Isaac ROS
- Humanoid navigation with Nav2 integration

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:
- Design and implement distributed control systems for humanoid robots using ROS 2
- Create accurate simulation environments that facilitate simulation-to-reality transfer
- Develop advanced perception, localization, and navigation systems using NVIDIA Isaac technologies
- Integrate multiple software components for complex robotic behaviors
- Apply domain randomization and system identification techniques to improve robot performance

## Target Audience

This course is designed for AI engineers and robotics students with a computer science background who want to understand the principles of physical AI and humanoid robotics.

## Getting Started

Begin with Module 1 to learn the fundamentals of ROS 2 middleware, then proceed to Module 2 to explore simulation techniques, and finally Module 3 to develop advanced perception and navigation capabilities. Each module builds upon the previous concepts to provide a comprehensive understanding of humanoid robotics.
